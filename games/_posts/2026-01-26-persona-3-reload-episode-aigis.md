Episode Aigis functions as a 30-hour epilogue to the events of Persona 3 Reload.  It doesn't add anything in the way of new mechanics, and instead functions similarly to the third semester in Persona 5 Reload.  From a story perspective, it does a great job of wrapping up how the characters are dealing with the events of the main game, specifically the very end of the game.  Without giving major spoilers away for the end of the base game, seeing how Yukari and Aigis especially are dealing with these events is incredibly well done.  They do seemingly cast the main character from the base game as some sort of Jesus figure, which is an interesting choice, but for the most part the story here continues and adds on to the themes of mortality and death established in the base content.

Unfortunately, the gameplay significantly drags the experience down. Episode Aigis strips away the usual Persona rhythm of dungeon crawling balanced with social links, replacing it with nonstop dungeon traversal through the Abyss of Time. This dungeon consists of 148 randomly generated floors spread across just four or five visual themes, resulting in an experience that quickly becomes monotonous. What starts as tolerable soon turns into a slog, with repetition and grinding overstaying their welcome.

That grind is what makes this DLC so frustrating.  The last hour or so of the content here is quite good.  Most of the story payoff and several of the more interesting battles are packed into the end, reminding you of what the experience could have been. Had the Abyss of Time been condensed into a 10–15 hour experience, Episode Aigis would have been far more enjoyable.  As it is, I'm glad that I got to see the epilogue to the main story, but I'm also quite glad that I'm done with Episode Aigis.
