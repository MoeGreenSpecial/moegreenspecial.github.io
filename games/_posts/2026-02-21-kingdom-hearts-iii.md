Kingdom Hearts III for me is a tale of two games.  The Disney themed worlds are a major step forward for the series because of their significantly increased size.  By increasing the size of these worlds, they feel more fun to explore and the Disney stories told within them are very engaging.  In particular, The Caribbean was a highlight of the entire series, with fun open world pirate ship combat encounters.  Corona was also a really fun world, allowing you to play through the Tangled story in both combat centric woods areas and in more story driven city areas in the town of Corona itself.

Unfortunately, Arendelle was a missed opportunity. Instead of having actual Arendelle, or even the Ice Palace, as something to explore and interact with the world is mostly just trudging up and down an ice mountain over and over again.  For such a popular movie, it felt like the world itself deserved to be fleshed out better.  However, to give the level its due, it does contain one of the best moments of the game with the "Let It Go" sequence.

The other half of the game focuses on Kingdom Hearts lore, which is a sharp contrast to the Disney worlds.  And that has gotten so convoluted over the course of the prior 10 games that I find it nearly impossible to follow at this point.  The story has too many characters to service, and the plot is so complicated, that when the game shifts into Kingdom Hearts mode it really loses my interest.  Kingdom Hearts III is structured so that nearly all the Disney worlds happen first, with very little of the lore sprinkled in, followed by a heavy dose of Kingdom Hearts lore with essentially none of the Disney fun.  That pacing made the game come to a halt for me as I approached the end.  Although I was able to finish in around 40 hours, I was extremely ready for Kingdom Hearts III to be over by the time I finished.

Kingdom Hearts III is probably the easiest of the Kingdom Hearts games, presenting very little challenge for most of the game.  However, once you get to the last world, the difficulty spikes up quite a bit.  It's still very manageable, and still much easier than prior games, but the change in difficulty is quite noticeable.  There are a ton of different combat systems in this game, but for the majority of the game you don't really need to interact with any of them.  Simply button mashing on attacks and triggering the different forms of your Keyblade is enough to get through nearly every combat encounter.  In fact, I rarely even needed to dodge or block for most of the game.  Once you get to the end, however, the combat speeds up significantly and playing defense becomes necessary for survival.

The ability to summon theme park rides in battle was a fun addition.  Once everything in a battle gets going, and especially if you've got one of these rides going on, the screen becomes chaotic.  As a result, it becomes incredibly difficult to read what's going on.  Since the game isn't particularly hard, this generally wasn't a problem.  However, in some of the final fights it did get a little frustrating trying to follow the flow of the combat.

Gummi ships return, and they're still one of my least favorite systems in Kingdom Hearts.  Their implementation in Kingdom Hearts III is, however, the best of the series.  You fly the ships around a 3D open space area, with optional combat encounters and resources to mine.  This felt much better than the on-rails experience of previous entries in the series.  I did find the ship's lack of maneuverability to be frustrating at times, especially near the end of the game when you need to fly your Gummi ship through the corridors of a larger spaceship.

I was dismayed at the simplification of the Hundred Acre Wood area in Kingdom Hearts III as compared to the previous games.  Here, the Hundred Acre Wood is still a collection of mini-games.  However, in contrast to the larger number of varied mini-games that had generally been available, there are only three here, and they all boil down to effectively the same mechanic.

In all, I had a lot of fun with the Disney worlds in Kingdom Hearts III, and the graphical upgrades here are a huge step up from the previous games.  However, the game felt dragged down by all the Kingdom Hearts lore and its button mashy combat.  I'm sure that people who are really into the lore of Kingdom Hearts and have memorized all the different characters and the relationships between them probably liked this a lot more than I did.  But for me, I'm glad to be done with Kingdom Hearts III.
