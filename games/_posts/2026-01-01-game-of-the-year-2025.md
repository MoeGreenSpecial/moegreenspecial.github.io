    What else is there to say? When I wasn't playing this game, I was thinking about this game.  The narrative hook of the Gommage was incredibly compelling, and the various twists and turns the story took kept me wondering what might happen next.  The cast of characters, notably Maelle and Verso, are well-developed and incredibly memorable.

    The combination of real time parry windows and turn based JRPG-like combat worked very well together (although, I do wish there was an ability to tweak the parry window a bit).  I really enjoyed the Pictos system as well, enabling you to earn perks for your characters by using them.  Finding the best setup for your party was deeply satisfying.

    This is to say nothing of the art style, where everything looks subtly as though it is painted, or the music.

    Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is not only easily my game of the year, it also has entered my personal pantheon of all-time favorites.

2. ![Avowed](https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co7nbb.jpg) [Avowed](https://backloggd.com/u/MoeGreenSpecial/review/2822430/)

    Avowed stands out to me as the Action RPG that made all the right small twists to the formula.  It really felt like whenever Obsidian had a choice to make about the game, they chose the option that would be the most fun.  It's not an overly long game, and instead of having one gigantic open world it's divided up into several smaller maps to explore.  Since the maps are smaller in scale, the team at Obsidian were able to spend more time hand-crafting each of them.  And that, in turn, made it incredibly fun to explore the world because each map was densely packed with things to find and do.  The world designs themselves are colorful and avoid the usual drab browns and grays of fantasy RPGs.

    The combat system was a completely fresh take on typical RPG leveling.  Your strength grows not by leveling up, but through your equipment.  Since equipment upgrade resources are scarce, you really need to spend time thinking about which equipment you liked the best so that you could continually advance against tougher and tougher enemies.

    I wasn't much for the lore of this one, but the companions were top-notch, notably Giatta, Yatzli and especially Marius. They are well written and have interesting stories of their own that develop across the game.

    When you have to make a choice in Avowed, rarely is there an obvious good choice and bad choice.  Further, the game is written in a way that often forces you to re-justify choices you have made in the past, which was a nice system for this style of game.

    This was perhaps the most fun of the non-mainline Yakuza games.  It ditches the typical Yakuza contrast between having a serious main story and light-hearted side quests in favor of being entirely in the wacky side quest style which works well for a Majima led game.  The naval combat here is quite fun, and had enough to think about between managing your crew and weapons as well as ship positioning to keep it engaging.  Because of that, the Pirate Coliseum was one of the better main mini-games in the series in quite some time. 

4. ![Dispatch](https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/cob5ql.jpg) [Dispatch](https://backloggd.com/u/MoeGreenSpecial/review/3654681/)

    Phenomenal.

    Dispatch is the best Telltale style game to date. It has incredible story, writing, and voice acting.  Each episode is only about an hour long, so none of it overstays its welcome either.  The actual dispatching is OK - although if you don't do well on a shift that can quickly snowball as you won't have enough XP to do well in the future.  Even so, it never stopped me from enjoying the rest of the game.

5. ![Doom: The Dark Ages](https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co9b3o.jpg) [Doom: The Dark Ages](https://backloggd.com/u/MoeGreenSpecial/review/2893792/)

    The third entry in the modern Doom series continues the series' incredibly fun combat encounters, but this time with a melee focus.  This causes the gameplay to be a bit slower than the last entries, but even so the shield was incredibly fun to use.  Graphically, of course, this game is gorgeous to look at, and it runs incredibly smoothly.  The story was completely nonsensical to me, but that doesn't take away from just how fun Doom: The Dark Ages was to play.

6. ![Mafia: The Old Country](https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/coa9dq.jpg) [Mafia: The Old Country](https://backloggd.com/u/MoeGreenSpecial/review/3235000/)

    Mafia: The Old Country really evokes the feeling that you're playing a classic mob movie, with more than just a little influence of The Godfather present throughout.  Gameplay wise, it's fine.  The stealth and third person shooting sequences were good enough, although I was not a fan of the knife-fight bits.  Structurally, the game is a little odd, where collectibles are scattered through an open world that really only seems to exist to hold those collectibles.  Since the open world isn't really accessible when doing the linear story sequences, having the open world at all felt superfluous.

    However, all of that said, I really did enjoy this. Playing as what was effectively a more competent version of Fabrizio, with the gorgeous cinematics and character work being done through the story, felt like something that's almost specifically made for me. And wow did it work. 

7. ![Donkey Kong Bananza](https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/coa082.jpg) [Donkey Kong Bananza](https://backloggd.com/u/MoeGreenSpecial/review/3291458/)

    Donkey Kong Bananza was good fun for a while, but did suffer from becoming a bit repetitive as it went on. The gameplay and controls felt good, and the different abilities used to solve different types of problems were unique and fun as well. However, despite having a variety of different levels to play in, the core loop of finding hidden bananas and fossils eventually wore thin, and by the end, I never felt much motivation to go back to the post-game content.

8. ![Ball x Pit](https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co9xid.jpg) [Ball x Pit](https://backloggd.com/u/MoeGreenSpecial/review/3642143/)

    Vampire Survivors meets Arkanoid, with a little bit of base building thrown in for good measure. Ball x Pit is probably the best of the Vampire Survivors-likes that I've played.  The core gameplay loop of going on a run to unlock money and blueprints that can then be used to upgrade your base, which then makes you stronger for the next run feels tight and satisfying. It never feels like it's dragging too much, and pretty much always feels like there's a goal to work towards.

    This is also one of the better entries in the genre of having you change up your play style from run to run. While the individual levels aren't too different from one another, the characters themselves all have unique quirks to their gameplay that force you to play them differently. While the core gameplay isn't difficult, having these tweaks is a nice way to keep the game fresh and engaging.

9. ![Hades II](https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/coaknx.jpg) [Hades II](https://backloggd.com/u/MoeGreenSpecial/review/3728812/)

    This is very much Hades 2, which I suppose is both a good and a bad thing. The fantastic gameplay, music, and art from Hades returns and are expanded upon with larger areas to guide your character through. However, this didn't feel as fresh to me as Hades did back in 2020, perhaps because of all the rougelikes that have come since then. The main thing that felt off about Hades 2 compared to Hades 1 is that in Hades 1 I always felt like I was progressing after each failure - whereas in Hades 2 there are so many different collectible currencies that need to be gathered, and so many different types of upgrades to go after, that many of my runs felt like I wasn't making much progress at all.

    It's still Hades, so it's still fun, but it didn't hit as hard as the original for me.

    This is a 4 or 5-hour journey through some unbelievable artistry. This game looks and sounds amazing, and the amount of work that must have gone into all the environments, many of which are only used for 20 or 30 minutes is incredible. All the artistic details, sound, and animation, are top-notch. There's not a lot here, but what is here is beautiful to look at and clearly had a ton of care put into it.

## Backlog Highlights
{: class="backlog-header" }
_Games from the past that still delivered in {{ page.goty_year }}._
{: class="backlog-subline" }

1. ![Persona 5 Royal](https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/cob86j.jpg) [Persona 5 Royal](https://backloggd.com/u/MoeGreenSpecial/review/3529377/)

    Persona 5 Royal was my first Persona game, and by the time I had wrapped it up it had elevated itself to one of the best games I have ever played.  Both halves of the experience complement each other really well.  Developing social links to give yourself bonuses that can then be used when crawling dungeons forms a satisfying core gameplay loop.  Each of the main dungeons is incredibly well-designed and themed, and many had some on-theme light puzzling to go along with the standard dungeon crawl.  Mechanics are added on as you advance through each of the dungeons so that combat doesn't wind up feeling stale even after 150 hours.  With that being said, Mementos can start to feel a bit grindy after a while, however having hand-crafted main dungeons to come back to helps break up the potential monotony there.

    The cast of characters and plot are incredibly well done, and each of the mini stories with the confidants (with the possible exceptions of Empress and Emperor) were interesting as well.  The characters in your party in particular stuck with me more than the characters from other Atlus games I've played.

2. ![Persona 3 Reload](https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big_2x/co6z12.jpg) [Persona 3 Reload]({% post_url games/2026-01-12-persona-3-reload %})

    After finishing Persona 5 Royal, I jumped into Persona 3 Reload.  While the game was good, it doesn't hold up nearly as well when viewed alongside Persona 5.  What was interesting, however, was seeing some of the ideas in Persona 3 more fully realized in Persona 5.  Story wise, Persona 3 was significantly darker than Persona 5 with themes heavily focusing on death and mortality.  And I would be remiss not to mention that the animation that plays when you summon your Persona involves your characters shooting themselves in the head with their evoker (which visually resembles a real gun).  This animation cannot be disabled or skipped.

    There are good bones here. The core gameplay is still fun, although Tartarus is a bit more grindy than the bespoke dungeons of Persona 5.  The story is dark, but compelling. The story is dark but compelling, and viewed through a historical lens, it was interesting to see how the series’ ideas and systems have evolved over time.

3. ![Alan Wake II](https://images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_cover_big/co6jar.jpg) [Alan Wake II](https://backloggd.com/u/MoeGreenSpecial/review/3160527/)

    Alan Wake II is really great at what it does, although what it does is not exactly for me.  It's an excellent survival horror game, which excels at building up a horror atmosphere throughout.  While I understand that the genre demands it, but I'm not a big fan of slow movement and very limited supplies and that was a bit off-putting to me.

    The Old Gods of Asgard sequences, however, are some that will stick with me for a very long time.

    I see why a lot of people love this one, but for me, it's just outside the type of game I enjoy playing.
