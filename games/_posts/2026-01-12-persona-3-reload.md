Coming to Persona 3 Reload from Persona 5 Royal, it's interesting to see the bones of what made Persona 5 so excellent in their nascent form.  And while Persona 3 is quite good, the comparison to Persona 5 is not flattering.  The game world itself is smaller, with fewer locations and less to do (although that may be fine, because the calendar in this game is significantly tighter than the one in Persona 5).  Tartarus being procedurally generated as opposed to the hand-crafted themed palaces of Persona 5 made the dungeon crawling feel much more grindy (although, to be fair, it's basically just a longer Mementos).  But most of all, I really miss how advancing your relationships in Persona 5 paid off with bonuses for the combat, where there was no such payoff here.

The story in Persona 3 was the real stand out part - it's significantly darker than the one in Persona 5, and extremely focused on death and mortality.  It seems much likely to stick with me for longer, despite the fact that I prefer the cast of characters from Persona 5.

I'd be remiss to not mention that the animation that plays when using any Persona powers is that the character shoots themselves in the head with a gun.  This animation cannot be disabled in any way, so you'll be seeing it a lot.  While I did eventually tune it out, pressing a button to make teenagers do that hundreds of times throughout the game was something that I was not a big fan of.

In all, there's good bones here, the core gameplay is fun, and the story is quite good.  The changes to the series as it went forward were all beneficial ones, which makes this interesting from a historical perspective to get a feel for how Atlus has evolved their games.
